## Issues with the dataset

* Only assign one class per sample while a lot of samples belong to multiple of motifs (mixed) (eg. Parang + Kawung, Ceplok + Kawung, Parang + Kawung + Ceplok)
* Lereng and Parang motifs are alike (many redundant training data)
* Variances in datasets: variances in image's size & layout
* A lot of irregular noises in samples eg. borders, watermarks even other object like mannequin

## Average accuracy

SIFT + BOW + SVM = 0.2167
SIFT + BOW + SVM + tuned dataset = 0.2553
VGG16 + NN = 0.55
VGG16 + NN + tuned dataset = 0.75
